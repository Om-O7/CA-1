2)A small poem on friendship

The Thread of Friendship

A thread so strong, yet soft and kind,
Woven through both heart and mind.
Through sunlit days and stormy skies,
A friend stands firm, with knowing eyes.

Laughter shared, a hand held tight,
A guiding star in darkest night.
No miles nor time can wear it thin,
True friendship glows from deep within.

3)today is a good day because it has good in it.
